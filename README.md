## About

<table>
<tr>
<td>

Collection Helper is a tool you can use to manage your collections in osu!. It aims to make editing  and sharing your collections quick and easy with its intuitive interface. Included is a very powerful custom filter interface which allows you to programatically filter through your beatmaps by writing your own code. 

The key features of **Collection Helper**:

- Add/remove/merge collections
- Edit collections
- Apply ingame filters to select maps
- Import and Export collections (WIP)
- Ability to create custom filters using javascript
- Inbuilt stream and farm filters
- Backup your collections

### Built With

- [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular)
- [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron)
- [Typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript)
- [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node)
- [SQLite](https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

[osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh)

Currently, port 7373 must be available, this will not be a requirement in the future. You can ignore this if you are not a developer.

You must have run your osu! client at least once.

### Usage

#### Build instructions

Please follow these steps to build the project yourself:

1. Pull the repo
2. Install dependencies in both frontend and backend (/ and /app/)
3. Run "npm run electron:build" (or "npm run start" to dev)
4. Run the installer found in /releases/

#### Custom filters

Custom filters work by passing you a list of beatmaps which get filtered by your code.

Any function you write must resolve with a list of beatmaps. Minimum boilerplate code is given when creating a new custom filter.

Your filter will be passed 3 objects: The resolve function, a list of beatmaps, and axios for any request needs.

If you want to use a beatmaps hit objects, you must select the Get HitObjects checkbox on the creation screen. Note: this will cause the filter to take a lot longer to cache, on my computer this is about 15 minutes for 87000 maps.

To use any custom filter in the collection edit screen, you must generate its cache first in the filters screen. This ensures the filters can be applied instantly to a list of maps instead of having to process every beatmap every time.
