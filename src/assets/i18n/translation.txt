RUSSIAN: ""

HELP.FILTERS.NAME
ENGLISH: "Filters"
RUSSIAN: ""

HELP.FILTERS.LINES.ONE
ENGLISH: "Filters run on all of your beatmaps. If a filter requires hit objects to be parsed (e.g. beatmaps) then calculating the filter will take a long time. For me this is about 20 minutes for 87000 maps."
RUSSIAN: ""

HELP.FILTERS.LINES.TWO
ENGLISH: "A filter must be cached before it can be used in the collection edit beatmap list. You can cache multiple filters at a time by using the checkboxes and clicking cache at the top of the table."
RUSSIAN: ""

HELP.FILTERS.LINES.THREE
ENGLISH: "Filter cache is saved, so unless you edit the filter, the only reason to generate the cache again is if you have downloaded more maps."
RUSSIAN: ""

HELP.FILTERS.LINES.FOUR
ENGLISH: "Caching multiple filters is recommended as the most expensive part is getting the beatmap data and if you cache multiple it only needs to get the data once for every filter."
RUSSIAN: ""

HELP.FILTERS.LINES.FIVE
ENGLISH: "You can create your own filters on the custom filter screen."
RUSSIAN: ""

HELP.CUSTOM_FILTERS.NAME

RUSSIAN: ""

HELP.CUSTOM_FILTERS.LINES.TWO
ENGLISH: "You must at some point resolve() the function otherwise it will run forever."
RUSSIAN: ""

HELP.CUSTOM_FILTERS.LINES.THREE
ENGLISH: "The basic idea of the filter system is you are passed a list of beatmaps as 'beatmaps' and you must filter these and resolve the filtered list of beatmaps."
RUSSIAN: ""

HELP.CUSTOM_FILTERS.LINES.FOUR
ENGLISH: "ONLY CHECK GET HIT OBJECTS IF YOU NEED THEM, IT INCREASES THE COMPUTATION TIME GREATLY!"
RUSSIAN: ""

HELP.CUSTOM_FILTERS.LINES.FIVE

RUSSIAN: ""

HELP.EDIT.LINES.TWO
ENGLISH: "You can apply any cached custom filters via selecting them in the dropdown and clicking apply cache. Click clear cache to revert to normal"
RUSSIAN: ""

HELP.EDIT.LINES.THREE
ENGLISH: "You can use any of osu!'s in-game filters to filter the beatmap list by typing them in the search. This implementation is less refined than the official one."
RUSSIAN: ""

HELP.EDIT.LINES.FOUR
ENGLISH: "I recommend applying any custom filter and writing some in-game filter e.g. (mode=0, status=r stars>5) and then using select all to add all filtered maps to a collection."
RUSSIAN: ""

HELP.IMPORT_EXPORT.NAME
ENGLISH: "Import / Export"
RUSSIAN: ""

HELP.IMPORT_EXPORT.LINES.ONE
ENGLISH: "Ideally, you should only import one collection at a time, then open osu!, wait for the maps to process, and then refresh the cache in collection helper."

RUSSIAN: ""

HELP.PRACTICE.LINES.TWO
ENGLISH: "You can specify the preferred length of each practice difficulty by changing the length setting."
RUSSIAN: ""

HELP.PRACTICE.LINES.THREE
ENGLISH: "A new collection will be made with all of the new maps."
